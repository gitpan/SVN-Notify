Revision history for Perl extension SVN::Notify

2.30  2004-10-19T05:20:02
      - Added "register_attributes()" class method so that subclases can
        easily specify their own attributes and the corresponding command-
        line options. This method will also create accessors for such
        attributes.
      - Moved the command-line option parsing to the new "get_options()"
        class method, so options specified via the "register_attributes()"
        class method can centrally be parsed from the command-line.
      - Removed the deprecated "format" option and parameter to new().
      - Added the "language" attribute to specify the language of the
        message, file names, and file contents.
      - Added the "linkize" attribute to SVN::Notify::HTML. When this
        attribute is set to a true value, URLs and email addresses in the
        log message will be turned into links.
      - Added new "bugzilla_url", "jira_url", and "rt_url" attributes to
        SVN::Notify. If present, these URLs will be used to create
        links from certain strings in the log message.
      - Changed the "viewcvs_url" attribute to require an "%s" format
        for the placement of the revision number to match the way the
        new URL attributes work. As an interim measure, SVN::Notify will
        append what it has always appeneded and emit a warning if there is
        no "%s" in the "viewcvs_url" string.
      - Fixed SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff so that it does not output two
        separate sections for a single file that was both modified (or
        added or deleted) and had properties set.

2.22  2004-10-15T06:12:46
      - Fixed diff parsing in SVN::Notitfy::HTML and
        SVN::Notitfy::HTML::ColoDiff to recognize added and deleted files.
      - Added links to files for which properties were set down into
        their place in the diff in SVN::Notitfy::HTML and
        SVN::Notitfy::HTML::ColoDiff.
      - Changed the class for each file in the diff output by
        SVN::Notitfy::HTML::ColoDiff to be specific to whether the file
        was modified, added, deleted, or just had its properties set.

2.21  2004-10-09T22:37:34
      - Tweaked HTML to make it all XHTML 1.1 compliant.
      - Switched to using attribute accessors instead of direct hash
        access in the subclasses to serve as a better example for others.
      - Changed the diff output methods to accept the diff input file
        handle as the second argument, so that it is created in only
        one place.

2.20  2004-10-09T20:01:28
      - Subclassing Module::Build in Build.PL to move and set the shebang
        line in test scripts during "./Build" instead of simply changing
        the shebang line in-place during "perl Build.PL".
      - Split the "start_message()" method into two methods, the second
        one called "output_metadata()", to separate starting the message
        and outputting content.
      - Added "output_css()" method to SVN::Notify::HTML, called by its
        "start_message()" method to output CSS for the HTML email.
      - Added CSS to the email in SVN::Notify::HTML.
      - Added links from the changed file list in HTML email to the
        included diff.
      - Added SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff, a new subclass that colorizes
        the diff when it is included in the HTML email message.

2.10  2004-10-07T06:18:59
      - Added many new methods to break up the various activities of
        assembling a notification message. This will make subclassing
        easier.
      - Moved all HTML notification functionality into a new subclass,
        SVN::Notify::HTML.
      - Added new "handler" parameter to new() and "--handler" option to
        svnnotify to specify what subclass should handle sending the
        notification. Just specify the name of a subclass, such as "HTML"
        for SVN::Notify::HTML. This replaces the "format" parameter, which
        is now deprecated.
      - Added code to Build.PL to set the shebang line in the test
        scripts. Reported by Robert Spier.
      - Changed name of attached diff file to be named for the revision
        and the committer, rather than the committer and the date.
        Suggested by Robert Spier.
      - Added Author, Date, and Revision information to the top of each
        message.
      - The ViewCVS URL is no longer output for each file. A single link
        for the entire revision number is put at the top of the email,
        instead. ViewCVS Revision URL syntax pointed out by Peter
        Valdemar Morch.
      - Changed the C<send()> method to C<execute()> to better reflect
        its generalized use as the method that executes actions in
        response to Subversion activity.
      - The tests no longer require HTML::Entities to run. The HTML
        email tests will be skipped if it is not installed.
      - Added accessor methods for the attributes of SVN::Notify.

2.00  2004-10-04T05:09:17
      - First release, ported from activitymail 1.11, but completely
        rewritten, with a new script interface and a separate class
        that manages everything.
      - Added "to_cx_regex" parameter to control the recipients based
        on how regular expressions match directory names.
      - Added "charset" parameter.
      - Added "user_domain" parameter.
      - Added "sendmail" parameter.
